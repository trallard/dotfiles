# dotfiles

This repo contains config files for various things (mostly for a macOS setup). The idea is to help me customise a new computer in an easy and smooth way.

Why? - It has taken me years and years to find settings that work for me. Using the included modular setup script, starting from a fresh installation of Ubuntu Linux or MacOS I can have everything I'm used to -- programs and all -- in a few minutes.

:warning: Since this is adapted to my own profile and usage **everything is super customised** use everything at your own risk :warning:.

This setup includes:
- bash config
- tmux config
- vim/neovim config
- zsh config
- installing many apps and tools I use day in and day out

## MacOS

**:zap: Update** now I am using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#getting-started):
to proceed run `./install` this will do all the magic and call `new_computer.sh` too.

## VSCode

I tend to use VSCOde as my default IDE. My current vs code settings are located in [https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/fffb079d42863bd72d96) which I sync using git-sync.

Though I also have activated [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) now on VSCode as I also like having my settings synced for CodeSpaces, my Linux subsytems and pretty much everything.

## Apps that need manual install

Though I would love to automate all my installs I have not managed to do it so far. Some applications that need to be manually installed are:

- Descript
- Audacity
- Camtasia
- ElGato Control Center
- Logitech G hub
- Logitech presentation (install from cask download)
- Logi Capture
- Moom
- Wally  (and CLI see ergodox)
- R and Rstudio
